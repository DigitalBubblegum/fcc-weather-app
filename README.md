# Weather App based on the take home project from Freecodecamp.

This is my repo for a simple weather app made with React and TailwindCSS.

## Build an app that fulfills the below user stories 

- [x]  I can see the weather in my current location.
- [x] I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
- [x] I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## install with:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
